                                                Currently, I am a student at North Carolina State University where I am majoring in 
                                                Electrical Engineering with a concentration in Renewable Electrical Energy 
                                                Systems & Computer Engineering, and minoring in Sustainable Energy. I aspire to 
                                                one day work with the Smart Grid dilemma with the hopes of fostering the productivity 
                                                of renewable energy and promoting sustainability.
                                    </p>
                                    <br />
                                    <p>
                                                My interest in renewable energy was bred from a multitude of experiences early on in my 
                                                life, the most profound being Scouting. Beginning in the First Grade I was immediately 
                                                surrounded by a community who appreciated the outdoors. This exposure fostered my affinity 
                                                for the natural world. As a scout, I grew to love the ever-so-often overlooked gift that is 
                                                the wilderness that surrounds human environments. Backpacking the Rocky Mountains, sailing
                                                through the Florida Keys, and kayaking the North Carolina Outer Banks were all contributing 
                                                experiences that led me to further appreciate the natural wonders present in our world today. 
                                    </p>
                                    <br />
                                    <p>
                                                Around the same time I began my Scouting journey, I also uncovered my love for computers.
                                                My interest developed from the enthusiasm of the media specialist at OLG, Jacky Hanner. 
                                                In “Computer Class” we designed clay-mations, advanced our typing skills, and even developed our own 
                                                html webpages. I drew a particular interest in code and web design. My love for 
                                                coding flourished and my exploration of the concepts behind the Internet and 
                                                computers has yet to end.

                                    <br />
                                    <p>         A group project in an Environmental Science high school course exposed me to renewable energy 
                                                and how this technology has the 
                                                potential to sustainably support all of our energy needs. This idea fascinated me, and led me 
                                                to begin researching the topic outside of school. The intricacies of how electricity is generated
                                                and transmitted drove me to research the seemingly endless complexities of the entire energy field. 
                                                I sprouted a desire to pursue 
                                                real world change through altering the way humans use and receive energy.

                                    <br />
                                    <p>            
                                                Later in high school and into the beginning of my postsecondary education I began
                                                to consider what major I wanted to pursue. While most undergraduate students 
                                                first pick a major that matches their interests and later fall under a 
                                                career-applicable field within that major, I found myself in the opposite 
                                                position. I’d already discovered the real world issue I wanted to tackle, my 
                                                setback was unearthing the major that would best maximize my potential, given my interests,
                                                at making a noticeable and a real impact.       
                                    </p>            
                                    <br />
                                    <p>            
                                                I found that I could apply my three pronounced interests – nature, computers, 
                                                and energy – towards one common goal – the mitigation of climate change, through 
                                                Electrical Engineering. Specifically, my pursuit of the Renewable Electric Energy
                                                Systems concentration offered at North Carolina State University will provide me 
                                                the tools necessary to offer real world solutions to instantaneously supplying 
                                                renewably generated electricity all across the United States through Smart Grid 
                                                technologies.  
                                    </p>            
                                    <br />
                                    <p>            
                                                I aspire to be a forefront leader in the development and 
                                                implementation of emerging renewable technologies. 
                                                I believe that through the development of renewable energy sources it will be 
                                                possible to, one day, cut ties with petroleum, coal and other toxic finite energy
                                                sources. Nothing makes me more passionate than the opportunity to be 
                                                a part of this change.
