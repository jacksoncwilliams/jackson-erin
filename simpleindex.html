                                                My interest in renewable energy was bred from a multitude of experiences early 
                                                on in my life, the most profound being Scouting. Beginning in the First Grade I 
                                                was immediately surrounded by a community who appreciated the outdoors. This 
                                                exposure fostered my affinity for the natural world. As a scout, I grew to love 
                                                the ever so often-overlooked gift that is the wilderness that surrounds human 
                                                environments.  Backpacking the Rocky Mountains, sailing through the Florida Keys,
                                                and kayaking the North Carolina Outer Banks were all contributing experiences 
                                                that led me to further appreciate the natural wonders out there in our world 
                                                today. Now as an Eagle Scout, I’m aware of the constant human destruction to our 
                                                planet. I want to do something about it.  
                                    </p>
                                    
                                    <p>
                                                Around the same time I began my Scouting journey, I also uncovered my love for 
                                                computers. By age 9 I had created my first html website and by age 15 I had 
                                                professionally developed websites for over seven reputable organizations. My 
                                                love for coding flourished and my exploration of the concepts behind the Internet
                                                and computers has yet to end. As I grew as a student I began to further uncover 
                                                factual evidence of the degradation of the Earth’s health.  Specifically, I 
                                                developed an interest in energy and how humans are wastefully burning an absurd 
                                                amount of fossil fuels. I sprouted a desire to pursue real world change through 
                                                altering the way humans use and receive energy. An Environmental Science high 
                                                school course exposed me to renewable energy and how this technology has the 
                                                capability of sustainably supporting all of our energy needs. This idea 
                                                fascinated me, and continues to drive my interest in this field.  
                                    </p>
                                    
                                    <p>            
                                                Later in high school and into the beginning of my postsecondary education I began
                                                to consider what career I wanted to pursue. While most undergraduate students 
                                                first pick a major that matches their interests and later on fall under a 
                                                career-applicable field within that major, I found myself in the opposite 
                                                position. I’d already discovered the real world issue I wanted to tackle, my 
                                                setback was unearthing the major that would best maximize my potential at making 
                                                a noticeable and profound impact to the issue I am passionately devoted.       
                                    </p>            
                                    
                        </div>
  
                        <div class="four columns">
                                    <h1> hello  2</h1>

            </div>
            
            <div class="container">

                                                I found that I could apply my three pronounced interests – nature, computers, 
                                                and energy – towards one common goal – the mitigation of climate change, through 
                                                Electrical Engineering. Specifically, my pursuit of the Renewable Electric Energy
                                                Systems concentration offered at North Carolina State University will provide me 
                                                the tools necessary to offer real world solutions to instantaneously supplying 
                                                renewably generated electricity all across the United States through Smart Grid 
                                                technologies.  
                                    </p>            
                                    
                                    <p>            
                                                I aspire to be a forefront leader on the development and 
                                                implementation of emerging renewable technologies such as photovoltaic solar 
                                                panels, wind energy turbines, hydrothermal power, and geothermal energy. 
                                                I believe that through the development of renewable energy sources it will be 
                                                possible to cut ties with petroleum and other harmful finite energy sources and 
                                                thus end the energy crisis thereby playing a lead role in the reversal of 
                                                climate change. Nothing makes me more passionate than the opportunity to be 
                                                apart of this change.
